# Usage

These "secrets" are example keys and certificates and are safe to share in that they were generated for the
sole purpose of demonstration in this example.   If you wish to provide localised, secret ones then copy this
folder to apache/build/config/shibboleth and set the environment variable LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR to ~/.config.  Then redeploy
docker containers.

Note that the example certificates in this folder are entirely dummy certificates.

See DEVELOPER.md on how to create certificates.
