# Usage

Example configuration files are located here.  If you wish to provide localised, secret ones then copy this
folder to ~/.config/shibboleth and set the environment variable LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR to ~/.config

Note that the example certificates in this folder are entirely dummy certificates.

See DEVELOPER.md on how to create certificates.
